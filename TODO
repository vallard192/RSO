Bugs:
  - spawns could extend into already generated chunks which would prevent their generation
  - crash after loading the game

Fixed bugs:
  - RSO_Surface.calculate_spawns() can get stuck in endless loop if there is too much water
  - resource spaws crossing chunk borders aren't generated properly (check ischunkgenerated)

Notes:
  - resource spawns are too small
  - generating too much drops performance
  - too much donuts
  - move n-balls away from center -> cooler spawns
  - proper water detection when deciding where to spawn
  - implement spawning of starting resources
  - resource property detection(starting, infinite)
  - read peaks when adding resource (if possible) to determine if spawn in starting area
  - Ores will be added in on_init, prepare that other mods are able to add their resources even if surface isn't generated yet (game.surfaces[name] should exist though)
  - enable/disable map_gen_settings for resources
  - provide basic resource configuration for prototype ores and data ores, full support only for rso-resource ores
  - resources will only spawn if the surface has a autoplace_control for that resource and size != none
  - one could make mixed spawns by deviding the location.sum into intervals and spawn A when <threshold and B >threshold

Implemented Notes:
  - resources at borders need to be added to appropriate region
  - implement biter spawn logic (1st iteration)
  - implement the ore spawn logic - done


Release:
  - implement liquid spawn logic

Planned Features:
  - Settings GUI
  - Migration from "old" RSO to new
