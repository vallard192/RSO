Bugs:
  - RSO_Surface.calculate_spawns() can get stuck in endless loop if there is too much water
  - resource spaws crossing chunk borders aren't generated properly (check ischunkgenerated)

Notes:
  - resources at borders need to be added to appropriate region
  - resource spawns are too small
  - generating too much drops performance
  - too much donuts
  - move n-balls away from center -> cooler spawns
  - proper water detection when deciding where to spawn
  - implement spawning of starting resources
  - resource property detection(starting, infinite)
  - read peaks when adding resource (if possible) to determine if spawn in starting area


Release:
  - implement Resource "class"
  - implement the ore spawn logic - done
  - implement liquid spawn logic
  - implement biter spawn logic

Planned Features:
  - Settings GUI
  - Migration from "old" RSO to new
